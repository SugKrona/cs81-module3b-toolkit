## What patterns or surprises did you notice?

- I noticed that most math functions follow a simple and clear pattern. Once I understood how one function worked, the others were easier to write.

## What logic challenged your thinking?

- I wouldnt say any of the logic behind the functions was challenging, but just making sure the code, predictions, and results all lined up. Testing each function carefully also made me more aware of how small typos can affect the result.

## How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?

- A math toolkit like this could be used and is definitely in apps, websites, or tools that require fast quick calcuations.
